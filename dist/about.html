            Hello, I am an entrepreneur. My specialties are in business and
            technology. I started my computer refurbishing company at the age of
            18. After several years of running that, I started to diversify my
            skills to other areas of business and sales, as well as furthering
            my knowledge in the field of software engineering. I am Microsoft,
            Comptia, and CIW certified, and I hope to hold a Bachelor of Science
            specializing in software development by the end of 2022.

          <h3>TVH Computers LLC</h3>
          <h6>CEO and Founder</h6>
          <p>
            In 2014 I launched my computer business. My company specializes in
            refurbishing computers and furnishing the local area's residents and
            businesses with computer repair and support services. Growth has
            been steady since moving to a larger, more heavily trafficked
            location, and with 3 employees, we now serve an average of 600 to
            1,000 customers every month.

          <h3>Software Developer</h3>
          <h6>Front End Developer</h6>
          <p>
            I fancy myself a software developer, although I have no back-end
            programming knowledge, I am starting with front-end, and so far I
            can easily follow a lengthy tutorial and basically understand how
            everything works. This website uses html/css, sass, javascript,
            json, and node.js.

          <p>
            One of my long term goals is to build a large real estate investment
            portfolio. I have bought and flipped 1 property, and I added my
            first rental property to my portfolio in 2016. I manage it myself
            and outsource any repair work that is out of my scope of expertise.
